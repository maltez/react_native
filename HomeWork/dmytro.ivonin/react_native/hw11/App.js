              `The data shows that email will continue to play a very important role in the event organizer‚Äôs promotional strategy. According to the latest events industry benchmark report, 40% of marketers believe email marketing is the most effective channel for event promotion. `,

              `Keep in mind that a consistent color scheme does not mean using the same exact color throughout the email. `,
              `It is more aesthetically pleasing to display a consistent color spectrum so that the design does not come off as one-dimensional. `,
              `In this example, the purple to pink spectrum gives a unifying feel that brings an aesthetic harmony to the overall email.`,
